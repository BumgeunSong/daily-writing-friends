# Firebase to Supabase Migration Plan

## Overview
Gradual migration from Firebase to Supabase with custom Kotlin/Spring Boot backend for learning purposes. Focus on safe migration with acceptable downtime windows.

## Current System Analysis

### Firebase Services in Use
- **Firestore**: Primary database (44K reads/day, 237 writes/day)
- **Firebase Auth**: User authentication
- **Cloud Functions**: Backend logic (42 functions across notifications, activity tracking, writing history)
- **Firebase Storage**: Profile images and post images
- **Firebase Analytics**: Event tracking
- **FCM**: Push notifications

### User Base
- ~100 active users
- Acceptable 24-hour downtime on weekends
- Small user base allows for maintenance notices

## Target Architecture

### Supabase Stack
- **Supabase Database (PostgreSQL)**: Replace Firestore
- **Supabase Auth**: Replace Firebase Auth
- **Supabase Storage**: Replace Firebase Storage
- **Supabase Edge Functions**: Minimal usage (prefer custom backend)

### Custom Backend (Kotlin/Spring Boot)
- **Spring Boot 3.x** with Kotlin
- **Spring Data JPA** for database operations
- **Spring Security** integration with Supabase Auth
- **WebSocket** for any real-time features (minimal usage)
- **REST APIs** following RESTful principles
- **Gradle** for build management

### Frontend Changes
- Maintain React Query for client state management
- Replace Firebase SDK calls with custom API calls
- Update authentication flow to use Supabase Auth
- Minimal changes to UI components

3. **Performance Degradation**:
   - Mitigation: Load testing before migration
   - Monitor key metrics post-migration

### Rollback Plans
- Each phase has a rollback plan to revert to Firebase
- Database backups before each migration step
- Feature flags to switch between old/new implementations

### Communication Plan
- Post maintenance notices 48 hours before migration
- Provide status updates during maintenance windows
- Have support channel ready for user issues
