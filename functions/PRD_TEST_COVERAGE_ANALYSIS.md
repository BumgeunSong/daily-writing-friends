# PRD Test Coverage Analysis

## PRD Requirements vs Test Coverage

### ✅ **MIDNIGHT TRANSITIONS**

| PRD Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **onStreak → onStreak** (posting on previous working day)<br/>- currentStreak: increment by 1<br/>- originalStreak: increment by 1 | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |
| **onStreak → eligible** (missed previous working day)<br/>- currentStreak: becomes 0<br/>- originalStreak: remains same | ✅ `resets currentStreak to 0 and preserves originalStreak` | ✅ **COVERED** |
| **eligible → missed** (recovery deadline passed)<br/>- currentStreak: becomes 0<br/>- originalStreak: becomes 0 | ✅ `resets both currentStreak and originalStreak to 0` | ✅ **COVERED** |
| **missed → missed** (no change)<br/>- currentStreak: becomes 0<br/>- originalStreak: becomes 0 | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |

### ✅ **POSTING TRANSITIONS**

| PRD Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| **missed → onStreak** (fresh start)<br/>- currentStreak: increment by 1 (starts from 0)<br/>- originalStreak: increment by 1 (starts from 0) | ✅ `sets both currentStreak and originalStreak to 1` | ✅ **COVERED** |
| **eligible → eligible** (progress update)<br/>- currentStreak: remains 0<br/>- originalStreak: remains same | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |
| **eligible → onStreak** (recovery on working day)<br/>- currentStreak: becomes originalStreak + 1<br/>- originalStreak: increment by 1 | ✅ `sets currentStreak to originalStreak + 1 and increments originalStreak` | ✅ **COVERED** |
| **eligible → onStreak** (recovery on non-working day)<br/>- currentStreak: becomes originalStreak<br/>- originalStreak: remains same | ✅ `sets currentStreak to originalStreak (no increment) and keeps originalStreak same` | ✅ **COVERED** |
| **onStreak → onStreak** (maintain streak)<br/>- currentStreak: increment by 1<br/>- originalStreak: increment by 1 | ✅ `increments both currentStreak and originalStreak by 1` | ✅ **COVERED** |

### ✅ **WORKING DAY VALIDATION**

| PRD Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Working Days: Monday-Friday in Seoul timezone | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |
| Non-Working Days: Saturday-Sunday | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |
| State changes only on previous working day misses | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |
| Posting impact varies by day type | ✅ Working day vs weekend recovery tested | ✅ **COVERED** |

### ✅ **RECOVERY REQUIREMENTS**

| PRD Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Working day recovery: 2 posts required | ✅ Implicit in recovery tests | ✅ **COVERED** |
| Weekend recovery: 1 post required | ✅ Implicit in recovery tests | ✅ **COVERED** |
| Posts must be written on same day | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |
| Recovery deadline calculation | ❌ **MISSING** | 🚨 **GAP** |

### ✅ **DATA MODEL**

| PRD Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| StreakInfo.originalStreak field | ✅ Used in all tests | ✅ **COVERED** |
| RecoveryStatus uses Timestamp types | ✅ Tests use Timestamp.fromDate() | ✅ **COVERED** |
| currentStreak vs originalStreak separation | ✅ Tests verify both fields | ✅ **COVERED** |
| Recovery deadline as Timestamp | ✅ Tests use Timestamp types | ✅ **COVERED** |

## 🚨 **CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED**

### **Missing Tests (High Priority):**

1. **Midnight onStreak → onStreak Maintenance**
   - When user posted on previous working day
   - Should increment both streaks by 1

2. **Midnight missed → missed Maintenance** 
   - Ensure missed state maintains zero streaks
   - Test state persistence

3. **eligible → eligible Progress Updates**
   - First post when 2 required
   - Verify currentPosts increment but streaks remain same

4. **Working Day Validation Logic**
   - Test that non-working day misses don't trigger state changes
   - Test weekend vs weekday posting behavior

5. **Recovery Deadline Logic**
   - Test deadline calculation
   - Test deadline expiration behavior

6. **Multi-Post Recovery Requirements**
   - Test that both posts must be on same day
   - Test partial recovery scenarios

## ✅ **WELL COVERED AREAS**

1. **Core State Transitions** - All major state changes tested
2. **Streak Arithmetic** - currentStreak/originalStreak calculations verified
3. **Recovery Completion Logic** - Working day vs weekend recovery
4. **Data Model Compliance** - Timestamp usage and field structure
5. **Integration Scenarios** - End-to-end transition flows
