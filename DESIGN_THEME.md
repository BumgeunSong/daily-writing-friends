### 50 Detailed Guidelines for Implementing the Premium Reading Theme

## Color System Implementation

1. **CSS Variables**: Replace all hard-coded hex colors with CSS custom properties (variables) from the theme system. Example: Use `bg-background` instead of `bg-[#ffffff]`.
2. **Monochromatic Base**: Maintain a pure grayscale foundation with HSL values where saturation is 0% for all base colors (background, foreground, card, etc.).
3. **Accent Color Application**: Apply the blue-gray accent color (`hsl(210, 40%, 92%)` in light mode, `hsl(210, 40%, 15%)` in dark mode) only to interactive elements, focus states, and subtle highlights.
4. **Color Opacity**: When reducing color opacity, use the Tailwind opacity modifier syntax (e.g., `text-foreground/80` for 80% opacity) rather than rgba values.
5. **Border Colors**: Use `border-border/50` for subtle borders (50% opacity) and `border-border` for more prominent ones (100% opacity).


## Typography and Readability

6. **Line Height**: Set body text line height to 1.7 (use `leading-relaxed` or the custom `text-reading` utility) for optimal readability.
7. **Font Size Hierarchy**: Maintain a clear size hierarchy with 16px (1rem) for body text, 14px (0.875rem) for secondary text, and 20px+ (1.25rem+) for headings.
8. **Font Weight**: Use font-weight 400 for body text, 500 for emphasis, and 600 for headings to maintain clear hierarchy.
9. **Letter Spacing**: Apply `-0.025em` letter-spacing to headings and normal letter-spacing to body text.
10. **Text Rendering**: Enable `text-rendering: optimizeLegibility` and font-smoothing for all text to enhance readability.


## Component Styling

11. **Card Design**: Style cards with `bg-card` background, `border-border/50` borders, and the `reading-shadow` utility class for subtle elevation.
12. **Button Styling**: Use minimal styling for buttons with subtle hover states. Primary buttons should use `bg-primary text-primary-foreground` while secondary/ghost buttons use `bg-transparent hover:bg-accent/50`.
13. **Badge Styling**: Style badges with `bg-secondary/80` background, `text-muted-foreground` text, and minimal padding (px-2 py-0.5).
14. **Input Fields**: Style inputs with `bg-input` background, `border-border` borders, and clear focus states using the `reading-focus` utility.
15. **Header Design**: Use `bg-card border-b border-border` for headers with adequate padding (py-3) and container constraints.


## Content Presentation

16. **Text Preview**: Limit content previews to 3 lines using `line-clamp-3` and ensure proper spacing between paragraphs with `prose-p:my-1.5`.
17. **Image Presentation**: Display images with rounded corners (`rounded-lg`), proper aspect ratios, and subtle shadows using the `reading-shadow` utility.
18. **Link Styling**: Style links with the accent color (`text-ring`) without underlines by default, adding underlines only on hover.
19. **List Formatting**: Apply proper spacing to lists with `prose-ol:my-1.5` and `prose-ul:my-1.5` to improve readability.
20. **Code Blocks**: Style code blocks with `bg-muted` background, `rounded-md`, and proper padding for readability.


## Spacing and Layout

21. **Vertical Rhythm**: Maintain consistent vertical spacing between components using multiples of 4px (0.25rem). Use `space-y-4` for card lists and `py-4` for section padding.
22. **Container Width**: Constrain content width using the `container` class with appropriate horizontal padding (`px-4`) to maintain readable line lengths.
23. **Card Spacing**: Apply `space-y-4` to card lists and `p-4` padding within cards for consistent spacing.
24. **Section Margins**: Use `my-6` or `py-6` for major section breaks and `my-3` or `py-3` for minor ones.
25. **Content Padding**: Apply consistent internal padding to content areas: `px-4 py-3` for card content and `px-4 py-2` for headers/footers.


## Interactions and Animations

26. **Hover States**: Apply the `reading-hover` utility to interactive elements, which adds `hover:bg-accent/50 transition-colors duration-200`.
27. **Focus States**: Use the `reading-focus` utility for keyboard focus states, which adds `ring-2 ring-ring ring-offset-2`.
28. **Transition Speed**: Set all transitions to 200ms duration for a premium feel: `transition-all duration-200`.
29. **Active States**: Apply subtle scale transforms on active/pressed states with `active:scale-[0.99]` for buttons and interactive cards.
30. **Loading States**: Use subtle pulse animations for loading states with `animate-pulse` and appropriate background colors.


## Accessibility Considerations

31. **Color Contrast**: Ensure text contrast ratios of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text against backgrounds.
32. **Focus Visibility**: Make focus indicators clearly visible with the `reading-focus` utility on all interactive elements.
33. **Text Alternatives**: Provide `alt` text for all images and `aria-label` for icon-only buttons.
34. **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible with proper focus order and interaction patterns.
35. **Screen Reader Text**: Use `sr-only` for text that should be announced to screen readers but not visually displayed.


## Mobile Optimizations

36. **Touch Targets**: Ensure all interactive elements have touch targets of at least 44×44 pixels for mobile users.
37. **Responsive Typography**: Scale down headings on mobile by 1-2px using responsive modifiers (e.g., `text-xl md:text-2xl`).
38. **Mobile Spacing**: Reduce horizontal padding on mobile with responsive classes: `px-3 md:px-4`.
39. **Card Layout**: Stack cards vertically on mobile with full width and reduced margins.
40. **Mobile Navigation**: Ensure the header is compact on mobile with appropriate spacing for touch targets.


## Dark Mode Implementation

41. **Dark Mode Colors**: Define separate dark mode colors in the CSS variables using the `.dark` class prefix.
42. **Dark Mode Shadows**: Adjust shadow intensity in dark mode to be more subtle using the `.dark .reading-shadow` selector.
43. **Dark Mode Text**: Slightly reduce contrast in dark mode by using off-white (`hsl(0, 0%, 95%)`) instead of pure white for better eye comfort.
44. **Dark Mode Borders**: Use lower opacity borders in dark mode (e.g., `dark:border-border/30`) for a softer appearance.
45. **Dark Mode Images**: Apply subtle brightness/contrast adjustments to images in dark mode if needed.


## Technical Implementation

46. **CSS Utility Classes**: Define custom utilities like `reading-shadow`, `reading-focus`, `reading-hover`, `text-reading`, and `text-reading-sm` in the global CSS file.
47. **Theme Provider**: Implement the theme provider from `next-themes` in your layout component to enable theme switching.
48. **CSS Variables**: Define all theme colors as HSL values in CSS custom properties for easy manipulation.
49. **Consistent Imports**: Use consistent import paths for UI components (e.g., `@/shared/ui/button`) throughout the application.
50. **Quality Checks**: Regularly audit the application for inconsistent styling, hard-coded colors, or accessibility issues using automated tools and manual review.


## Bear App Style Implementation (심플하고 프리미엄한 느낌)

51. **Minimal Borders**: Remove unnecessary borders from headers and wrapper containers to achieve a clean, Bear-app-like aesthetic. Headers should use only `bg-card` without `border-b`.
52. **Content-First Approach**: Eliminate redundant container wrappers that add extra borders, backgrounds, or shadows around content lists. Let individual cards provide their own elevation.
53. **Visual Hierarchy Simplification**: Use only essential visual elements - each PostCard should have its own `reading-shadow` and `border-border/50`, while avoiding additional container decoration.
54. **Premium Simplicity**: Follow the principle that less visual noise creates a more premium, focused reading experience. Remove borders that don't serve a clear functional purpose.
55. **Natural Content Flow**: Allow content to flow naturally without artificial container boundaries, similar to Bear app's seamless content presentation.
